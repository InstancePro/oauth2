mfc/oauth2
==========

This extension provides OAuth 2.0 to TYPO3 installations (only version 8LTS for the time being).

It can automatically create new backend users whenever OAuth authentication succeeds for a user that has not been created yet. Depending on the capabilities of the OAuth resource server used it can also enable admin permissions or assign a configurable backend user group.
